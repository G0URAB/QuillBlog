# Notes
1. No worries for database connection because I am using sqlite which is a portable database and is being easily integrated with Symfony.
2. Download the project folder and from inside the project run a terminal and type this command "php -S localhost:8000 -t public" to start the server with "public" as root directory.
3. Visit the application at http://localhost:8000 and now you can make new blogs and put contents in those blogs using Quill API.
